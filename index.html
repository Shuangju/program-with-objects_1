          <h3> <a id="C1">1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</a> </h3>
          <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this"). In OO programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. There is significant diversity in object-oriented programming, but most popular languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determines their type.​Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects and data.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"> Wikipedia Link </a> <br> Python is an object-oriented programming language. </p>

          <h3><a id="C2">2. Class </a> </h3>
          <p>A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. </p>
          <p> You can create a class by grouping a few related functions together.</p>
          <p> Class is like a blueprint.</p>

          <h3> <a id="C3">3. Object </a></h3>
          <p>A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.</p>
          <p> Object is like a specific building that is built from a blueprint.For example: Brad & Angie are objects of Class Turtle.</p>

          <p>A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference. </p>
          <p>A module can define functions, classes and variables. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. </p>
          <p>You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file.</p>

            <h3><a id="C10">10. Python Standard Library </a></h3>
            <p>Python’s standard library contains hundreds of modules that provide tools for interacting with the operating system, interpreter, and Internet. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized
              solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming.

            <h3><a id="C11">11. Why is <span class="bold">"OOP"</span> a valuable tool for thinking about large progarmming projects? </a> </h3>
            <p>Python classes are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've created a class once, you never have to create it again. Classes group functions (in a class they are called methods) that belong together. This is sort of
              what modules do. However, classes have a leg up on modules, they have a way to inherit other classes and establish a tree search structure for attributes in any of these inherited/linked classes. Classes help reuse code, and the ease of reuse of existing code makes a difference as you write larger programs.</p>
              <p> For example, you want to create a webpage for favorite movies. Once you create a class "Movie", you can use class "Movie" to create differnt instances, like Toy Story, Cars, Avatar, etc. By using classes, programmers can write less codes and save a lot of time and effort. And it reduces the chance to make mistakes.

            <h3><a id="C12">12. Method Overriding </a></h3>
            <p>Overriding is the ability of a class to change the implementation of a method provided by one of its ancestors.
              <br> Overriding is a very important part of OOP since it is the feature that makes inheritance exploit its full power. Through method overriding a class may "copy" another class, avoiding duplicated code, and at the same time enhance or customize
              part of it. Method overriding is thus a strict part of the inheritance mechanism.</p>

            <h3><a id="C13">13. Three Crucial questions we always need to ask before coding a new project.<a></h3>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>What is the input?</li>
                <li>What is our output?</li>
                <li>How are we going to get from input to output?</li>
            </p>
            <p>No matter what progamming language we use (HTML, CSS, Python, etc.), we always need to ask these three questions. These key questions will help us outline a plan to code any project.
              <br> Object-Oriented Programming is a useful way to organize information in a conceptual way.This new way to create a data structure allows us to represent our concept in an object giving us the freedom to manipulate our objects in a concise
              and efficient way.</p>

            <h3><a id="C14">14. Connections between OOP and CSS classes & HTML <a></h3> 
            <p> 
              <mark>*Saves a lot of work by avoiding repetition,</mark> <br>Pathon classes help with re-using codes. Once we create a class, we can use it to create many different instances.<br>
            CSS avoid repetition as well. The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files. With an external style sheet file, you can change the look of an entire Web site by changing just one file!<br>
              <mark>*Avoiding Errors</mark> <br>
              When programmers use CSS or Pathon classes, they don't need to do the same thing over and over. Then they have less chance to make mistakes.<br>
              <mark>*Consistency and more reliable</mark><br>
              By using CSS, programmers can give similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class. So the similar or related contents can be displayed on the webpage in the same style.<br>
              By using Pathon classes, we will ensure each instance has the same attributes we want.
